# ATM-Simulation-Program
The ATM Simulation Program is a beginner-friendly Python project that replicates the basic functions of a real Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to log in securely using a PIN and perform essential banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and exiting safely.

Concept Used 

Predefined Objects: int, float, str, dict, list

Typecasting: Converting user input to numeric types

Operators: Arithmetic and logical operators for calculations

Mutable & Immutable: Balance updates vs. constant PIN

Loops & Conditionals: Continuous menu and decision-making logic

Future Enhancements:

Add multiple account support

Implement transaction history

Add 3 login attempts security feature

Save account data using text or JSON files
